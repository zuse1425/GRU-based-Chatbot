# GRU-based Chatbot Project

## Overview
This project implements a conversational AI chatbot using a GRU-based sequence-to-sequence model. The chatbot is capable of generating contextually relevant responses based on user input. It leverages an encoder-decoder architecture with attention mechanisms to capture the contextual and sequential dependencies in dialogues.

The provided Python notebook demonstrates the complete pipeline for building and training the chatbot. It includes data preprocessing, vocabulary creation, model implementation, training loop, and an interactive inference module to test chatbot conversations. The notebook also utilizes a movie dialogue dataset for training, showcasing the practical application of GRU-based architectures in conversational AI.
